# Music Matcher Profile
This application takes you into the bubbly and colorful world of K-pop! In the library there are about 36 groups, ranging from boy groups, girl goups, and genre. In this application a user will login and take the mini-match quiz to find the perfect group that fits their style! Choose what genre you enjoy and whether you enjoy boy groups or girl groups, and viola! You found your match.

## Motivation
Music is a huge passion of mine. One of my favorite things to do is to find different kinds of music from all over the world. I especially enjoy listening to K-pop, considering the hundreds of talented groups out there. It is a very fun genre to listen to and I recommend it for everyone.
